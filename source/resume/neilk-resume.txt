Work Experience

  Software Engineer, Wikimedia Foundation

    December 2009 - present

   The [8]Wikimedia Foundation is the organization behind [9]Wikipedia. I
   have been working on multimedia usability issues, by adding features to
   the PHP backend and creating a jQuery-based frontends. All work open
   source. Most work concentrated in [10]UploadWizard extension and
   [11]UploadStash module, or see my full [12]commit log.

  Software Engineer, Yahoo (Flickr)

    August 2008 - April 2009

   [13]Flickr is one of the leading photo-sharing websites in the world. I
   joined the PHP team and made various improvements to Flickr's payment
   system and FlickrMail. I was let go as part of Yahoo-wide layoffs in
   April 2009.

  Software Engineer, Yahoo (Upcoming.org)

    December 2006 - August 2008

   [14]Upcoming.org is a collaborative events calendar, acquired by Yahoo
   in 2005, using PHP and Perl. I integrated event listings into Yahoo
   Search, redesigned the event data and geographic models, improved user
   interface and responsiveness, wrote a deploy system to automatically
   optimize site load time, wrote a Facebook app in the first weeks of the
   platform's existence, and mentored new hires. Received Excellence and
   Hack Day Awards in 2008.

  Software Engineer, Google

    September 2005 - October 2006

   I was part of the team that launched [15]Google Checkout, a Java-based
   commerce and payments system. My role was to refactor Google Checkout
   for international markets. This included the frontend, the data store,
   order processing and taxation policy, the Merchant API, and even
   customized ways to create your Google Account.

  Developer, Enfold Systems

    April 2005 - July 2005

   [16]Enfold Systems provides consulting and enterprise tools for Plone,
   an open source, Python-based content management system. I left the
   company amicably when I got a job offer from Google.

  Lickr, open source project

    April 2005

   [17]Lickr was the first complete AJAX interface for [18]Flickr,
   implemented as a Greasemonkey extension for Firefox. Previously, Flickr
   had relied on Flash and it was an [19]open question whether an AJAX
   interface was even possible or desirable. Flickr followed soon after
   with their own AJAX interface for all browsers.

  Self-employed Consultant

    May 2002 - November 2004

   During this period I consulted for a number of clients, particularly
   Vision2Hire Solutions (acquired by [20]BrainHunter), a maker of online
   human resources software.

  Developer, ActiveState Corporation

    September 2000 - December 2001

   [21]ActiveState produces tools for scripting language programmers. I
   re-engineered [22]Programmer's Package Manager Server, part of a system
   for installing Perl and Python software libraries. I also helped
   architect and code the [23]ActiveState Programmer Network, a site which
   aggregated knowledge about such languages.

  Systems Architect, Stylus Strategic Communications

    June 1997 - November 1999

   At Stylus, I designed and programmed web applications for some of
   Canada's most successful corporations.

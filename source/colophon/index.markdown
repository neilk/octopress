This site is produced with the static site generator [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).

I wrote several custom Octopress plugins to manage and create content, particularly to pull in images and
video from [Flickr](http://flickr.com/). They are free to use, but at the moment you will have difficulty 
extracting all the changes you need to make from [my Octopress fork](https://github.com/neilk/octopress).

The theme is a heavily modified version of [darkstripes](https://github.com/amelandri/darkstripes) by [Alessandro Melandri](http://melandri.net/).

The titling typeface is [Alegreya](http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar/tipografias/alegreya/ejemplos.html) 
and the body typeface is [Telex](http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar/tipografias/telex/ejemplos.html), both 
by [Huerta Tipographica](http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar/). Both are available under the
the [SIL Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL), from the publisher, and also via [Google Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/webfonts). A bold version
of Telex was generated algorithmically with [FontForge](http://fontforge.org/) for occasional emphasized words.

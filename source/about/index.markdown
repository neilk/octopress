Hello. Thank you for visiting.

Many people know me for some one-off [hacks with graphics and UI](/blog/categories/hack/). I'm glad if you enjoy those!

But I've really spent most of the last decade pushing bits through
some of the [biggest sites on the internet](/resume/). Sometimes building cool
new features, but more often scaling up or refactoring just in time
to prevent everything from falling apart. I always had the sense
that the people who came before me had had a lot more fun than I
was having.

I've learned so much doing this -- in particular, my Google experience
made me a vastly better engineer, the Yahoo/Upcoming/Flickr experience put me in
touch with some of the most creative people on the web, and my
Wikipedia experience has shown me what a truly empowered community looks like.

But I think it's time for me to get back into creating new things, to make
those early mistakes, rather than be the one who shows up later to fix them.

So now is the time for new ideas, both serious and frivolous, things that I hope
will change the world, and some things that I hope just make you smile.

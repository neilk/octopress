------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some excerpts from my diary during the first few months of the
existence of Netscape Communications <http://home.netscape.com/> (All
Praise the Company), back when we were still called Mosaic
<http://home.mcom.com>. Back when there were only 20 or 30 of us,
instead of however-many thousands <impressions.html> of people there are
today. Back before we /had/ any middle managers <phones.html>.

This is the time period that is traditionally referred to as ``the good
old days,'' but time always softens the pain and makes things look like
more fun than they really were. But who said everything has to be fun?
Pain builds character. (Sometimes it builds products, too.)

So you want to go work for a startup
<http://www.suck.com/daily/96/09/06/>? Perhaps this will serve as a
cautionary tale...

*Tuesday, 26 July 1994, 4am.*

    I've been working here at Mosaic for a month and a half now, and I
    haven't been sleeping <eyedream.html> much, or even going home
    <fridge.html> very often.

    Lou <http://people.netscape.com/montulli/> and Rob
    <http://people.netscape.com/robm/> spent all day today building
    remote control cars <http://people.netscape.com/robm/rc.html>. This
    was kind of annoying, since I and all the others were working out
    butts off, and they were just screwing around all day. I wandered
    over to Chouck <http://people.netscape.com/chouck/>'s cube and said,
    ``so is this car thing annoying you?'' He reached his arms wide,
    scrunched up his face, and said ``Only about /this/ much.'' I
    nodded, and went back to my desk.

    Ten minutes later he came over and asked, ``So does it annoy you
    too, or were you just wondering whether it annoyed me because I'm so
    easily annoyed?'' I said that it annoyed me, but probably a tiny bit
    less than it did him.

    At around 4pm, Lou was packing up and preparing to go home, when he
    mentioned to me that Marc <http://people.netscape.com/marca/> had
    called him in to his office and asked if he had enough work to do.
    I'd been wondering that myself, so I asked, ``Well, do you?'' He
    said that he had just been feeling really burnt out for the last few
    days, and needed to relax. This is completely understandable, but I
    said that maybe it would be better if he were to do his relaxing
    away from the office, instead of doing it right in everyone's face
    while they were working.

    Marc wants me to be done with the Unix client in time for SGI to
    ship it along with Irix 5.3. That means that it has to be rock solid
    in, like, less than two months. I've got so little of the code
    written that I don't even have a sense yet of whether that's even
    remotely possible; it's all over the floor. We've got bits and
    pieces, but I don't see the big picture. It'd be really easy to let
    him bully me into agreeing, but I don't want to miss; the stakes are
    too high this time, too many people are watching us for us to be
    able to screw up at all...

*Thursday, 28 July 1994, 11pm.*

    I slept at work again last night; two and a half hours curled up in
    a quilt underneath my desk, from 11am to 1:30pm or so. That was when
    I woke up with a start, realizing that I was late for a meeting we
    were scheduled to have to argue about colormaps and dithering, and
    how we should deal with all the nefarious 8-bit color management
    issues. But it was no big deal, we just had the meeting later. It's
    hard for someone to hold it against you when you miss a meeting
    because you've been at work so long that you've passed out from
    exhaustion.

*Sunday, 5 August 1994, 5am.*

    I just got home; the last time I was asleep was, let's see, 39 hours
    ago. And I'm not even tired right now. I guess I'm on my second or
    third or eighteenth wind. I only came home because I was worried
    that if I stayed there any longer, I'd fall asleep at the wheel
    again. I didn't want to stay down there for another night, because I
    /really/ need a shower at this point; it was a hot day today, and
    Lou and I played some intense games of air hockey last night that
    got me all sweaty and disgusting.

    Wow, I must be tired -- I just turned on the television, and MTV is
    actually moving too fast for me to understand it.

    I've had a sore throat and a cough for about a week now, but I
    haven't done anything about it, because I don't have time. I think
    I'm keeping myself from getting a cold <butterfly.html> by sheer
    force of will.

    On friday, which is when I most recently woke up, I got to work at
    around three, and had a ton of email waiting, all work related. And
    we had an all-hands meeting 4pm, and everyone wanted to come talk to
    me at once before then, so I was feeling really overwhelmed and
    behind. I mean, I had only been away from the office for like seven
    hours! The meeting was another mind-blower; apparently we closed
    some kind of OEM deal (I forget with who) for like 600,000 seats of
    the client. Gag. I actually get the feeling that our sales and
    marketing people know what they're doing! I've never gotten that
    feeling from them at any previous job. This is wild.

    Six hundred thousand people is more than any software I've ever
    worked on has come anywhere near. I'm completely terrified.

    The company is finally putting a web server online soon, so one of
    the content guys asked us to make home pages <blowme.html> for
    ourselves. I scribbled down a few of the weirder dreams I've had,
    and put up my bookmarks <../bookmarks.html>. Maybe I'll have time to
    do something more clever later.

    My hands have been really been hurting lately; I hope all this
    typing hasn't finally blown out my wrists. If I can't type, my life
    is over. My right hand especially is flaking out -- the last knuckle
    of the middle two fingers ache, as if they're badly bruised. I guess
    it's time to figure out how to use our medical program. As if a
    doctor is going to tell me something other than ``stop typing so
    much.'' Ha ha ha, that's a good one.

    A week or two ago we all sat around and tried to think up a name for
    the client; we can't call it Mosaic, because that's the name of the
    company. The marketroids <dig.html> had all kinds of silly
    suggestions like /Cyber/ this and /Power/ that and blah-blah /Ware/.
    Then someone said something about crushing NCSA Mosaic, and I
    blurted out ``/Mozilla!/'' Everyone seemed to like that, so I think
    that might end up being the official name of the browser.

    There's finally an Indy on my desk instead of a Sun4. This means
    that I also have an IndyCam, so I hacked up a script to grab and
    save a frame of me sitting there every five minutes. What have I've
    learned from this?

        * I bite my nails too much.
        * When I'm concentrating, I don't look very happy.
        * After I've been here more than a day, time-lapse photography
          reveals my hair and skin getting progressively more shiny...
          We really need to get showers at the office. 

*Thursday, 11 August 1994, 2am.*

    I saw Ian today, for the first time in months. His first words were,
    ``Wow, you look like shit.'' He says I seem really strung-out and
    twitchy. I thought I had been doing ok! I got a full night's sleep
    last night and everything. I have no life. I never see any of my
    non-work friends, and I'm wasting away my one and only youth. I
    ought to be out doing fun things and active things, the kind of
    things I won't be able to do when my mind and body finally decay.
    But instead I'm stuck inside under fluorescent lights, pushing bits
    around inside a computer in ways that are only interesting to other
    nerds. I glanced at a movie listing and there are movies out that I
    haven't even /heard/ of. How did that happen? That freaks me out.

    I bought some wrist braces at a drug store, and I've been typing
    with them for a couple of days. I don't think it's helping much; my
    middle finger doesn't hurt /quite/ as much, but my ring finger is
    just as bad. This job is destroying my body. This can't be worth it.

*Friday, 26 August 1994, 1am.*

    I've just read over some of my diary for the last few months, and
    man, a lot of it is /completely/ incoherent! It's full of incomplete
    sentences, made up words, random surreal imagery that I can't even
    understand let alone remember typing. Have I been typing in my
    sleep? I hope I don't sound like that in person. I wonder what my
    /code/ must look like! Oh well, it seems to work.

    I left work at about 9:30, because Eric and Susan called and talked
    me into going to see Natural Born Killers
    <http://us.imdb.com/Title?Natural%20Born%20Killers%20%281994%29>
    with them. I'd been at work for 31 hours, with maybe 4 hours of
    sleep scattered in here and there while waiting for compiles to
    finish, but they had already bought me a ticket for the 10:30 show,
    how could I say no? I said, ``I'm exhausted, but you're right, I
    need see a movie.'' Susan said, ``are you sure? We could do this
    some other time.'' ``No,'' I said, ``I'm burning twice as brightly,
    I have to do this sort of thing.'' It's a corny Blade Runner
    reference, but it just popped right out of my mouth. (I'm not sure I
    like the implications of it, actually.)

    /NBK/ was a completely amazing movie. I think it was very nearly
    perfect. Little plot, very disjoint, and fascinating visuals every
    step of the way. Every second in the first hour was beautiful, and
    most of the second hour as well. It was pure ultraviolence, even
    more over-the-top than A Clockwork Orange
    <http://us.imdb.com/Title?Clockwork%20Orange%2C%20A%20%281971%29>. I
    was grinning about it for hours, and Susan was just stunned -- she
    said she felt like she had been beaten about the head for two hours.
    When we got back to their place she went rummaging through their
    cabinets for alcohol, finally coming up with a bottle of bourbon;
    ``I need something to numb it down,'' she explained.

*Sunday, 28 August 1994.*

    Mozilla is actually starting to smell like a product; maybe we're
    not doomed after all. When I got to work today, the gang was sitting
    down to watch Repo Man
    <http://us.imdb.com/Title?Repo%20Man%20%281984%29> on laserdisc. I
    heartily approve, and I didn't even feel that guilty for blowing off
    a couple of hours to watch it.

    Lou is all stressed out because Kathy kissed him yesterday. I think
    he's nervous about dating the boss's daughter. He's all knotted up
    inside about her; relationships will do that to you. But someone
    pointed out that lack of sleep <bugmandream.html> will do that to
    you, too. We had a long talk about relationships today, where we
    traded war stories <rushour.html> and compared scars
    <obsession.html>. Here's a great snippet of a conversation we had
    about one of his previous girlfriends:

          *him: *		``...and she was really hung up about whether I found
          her attractive.''
          *me: *	``Why was that?''
          *him: *	``Well, once before we were going out, I told her that
          I didn't find her at all attractive.''
          *me: *	``Whaaaat?''
          *him: *	``Yeah, well, I said I wasn't attracted to her.''
          *me: *	``Well which did you say? There's a big difference...''
          *him: *	``Well, I guess I actually said that she wasn't
          attractive.'' /Pause./ ``But it's true <semantics.html>!''

    He's a real pro, that one. Fabio could take lessons.

*Friday, 9 September 1994, 1am.*

    We sent a copy of Mozilla to SGI today, for a handful of people to
    beat on. This the big moment when they decide whether we're in or
    out, whether they ship it with Irix 5.3, or tell us to get lost.
    Tomorrow they're going to do install an internal beta release on two
    thousand machines. I think that as of today, maybe five people
    besides me have ever used the Unix version.

    Oh, I just found out that my picture was in this month's Wired,
    which has a gushing article
    <http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/mosaic.html> about us. I
    look like a complete dork. I can just hear mom's reaction: ``What
    have you done to your hair? You look like a complete dork.''

*Saturday, 17 September 1994, 2pm.*

    If I hear someone imitate Beavis and Butthead one more time...

*Wednesday, 21 September 1994, 7pm.*

    Today we were having some argument in email about something or
    other, and a while later Aleks <http://people.netscape.com/atotic/>
    and I were chatting in person, and he said that he thought I'd been
    picking on Lou a lot lately. I didn't think I had been, so I sent
    this message:

          To: eng

          So, Aleks just said that he thinks I've been picking on Lou a
          lot lately. Well I just want to make it clear that I think
          you're all idiots, and I hate each and every one of you. I
          don't mean to single anyone out.

                Love,
                      -- Jamie

    One of my friends asked me if any of my coworkers had had anything
    to say about that, or if they were all just non-confrontational
    nerds who would go home and whine at their friends about how
    /difficult/ I am. I was happy to report that my coworkers are far
    from non-confrontational, and that we scream at each other all the
    time. It's one of the few things that makes this place bearable,
    that we're able to vent. However, this wasn't a great example of
    that, since the only responses I got were a halfhearted ``fuck you
    too'' sort of reply, and one that said, ``you forgot to cross-post
    that to alt.fan.jwz <news:alt.fan.jwz>.''

    I ate like a pound of goldfish crackers today. What was I thinking.

*Saturday, 24 September 1994, 5pm.*

    We had one of those ``we're going to win big'' meetings today, where
    Jim <http://people.netscape.com/jim/> and Marc
    <http://people.netscape.com/marca/> wave their arms a lot and say
    ``these are not the droids you're looking for,'' and we all sit
    there and nod enthusiastically and grin and say ``these are not the
    droids we're looking for.'' I like those meetings, because they're
    so convincing. They make me feel like maybe I haven't been wasting
    my time. You need someone like Marc around to overcome the
    soul-sucking blackness that sets in when you've agreed to impossible
    goals.

    I've been working, trying to beat this accursed Unix
    <http://catalog.com/hopkins/unix-haters/login.html> client into
    shape, and everyone else has been dipping into the corporate beer
    supply. You know, I spend basically every waking hour with these
    guys, and I think we get along remarkably well, considering, but
    it's really starting to wear thin. Add alcohol, and they all get
    Extra Special Annoying.

*11pm.*
    Well the kids went out to get drunk, or rather, more drunk. I think
    they might have actually gone out to a strip club again. How classy
    is that? 

*3am.*
    Oh good, the kids are back, and they are well hammered. None of them
    can walk properly, and they keep bumping into the cubicle walls and
    making everything on my desk shake. Since I'm not drunk, the
    impedance mismatch makes it impossible for me to carry on a
    conversation with them, so I'm just trying to block them out. But
    now they're all playing networked DOOM
    <../tent-of-doom/nscp-doom.jpg> at top volume, so in order to
    concentrate, I have to wear headphones with music on at top volume,
    and even that doesn't quite work. Since, as I mentioned, they keep
    making the mistake of trying to walk, and they're making all the
    shit on my desk bounce <bang.html> around.

    It's a saturday night, and I'm in my cubicle surrounded by a bunch
    of drunken farmboys <slaughter.html> from Illinois who haven't been
    more than two miles from our office in scenic downtown Mountain View
    in four months.

    My ears are going to be ringing after this. Fuck it, I'm going home
    <woodland.html>. (Check that -- my ears /are/ ringing.)

*Wednesday, Tuesday, who the fuck knows.
Some time in September, really really late at night.*

    We're doomed.

    We've finally announced a public beta to the net, and there are
    loads of bugs, and they're /hard/ bugs, sucky, hardware-dependent
    ones. Some of our private beta testers crash at startup on some
    SunOS 4.1.3 systems, and I've got what seems like an identical
    system here and it doesn't crash. And scrolling text doesn't work
    with the OpenWindows X server, though it works fine elsewhere. And
    the cache is still fucked. We're doomed.

    And while agonizing about this on the way home at 1am on an empty
    freeway, I forgot to keep an eye out for cops, and got a speeding
    ticket. I was going 80, and he actually /wrote me up/ for 80, the
    bastard. Since that's more than 20 over the limit, I think the fine
    print says that that means I have to go to court <rbarip.html>. I
    don't have time for this shit!

    Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
    Doomed doomed doomed doomed doomed.

    I'm tempted to just stay home tomorrow. I'm so fucking burnt.
    Existence is suffering.

    We had another fashion shoot today, with about ten of us. We did it
    outside at the civic center, and I think the photographer was pretty
    annoyed at us. Nobody was very into it at all, especially
    Middlefinger <http://people.netscape.com/jonm/>.

    We're doomed.

    I'd work on my resumé, but I don't even have anything /new/ to put
    on it yet, because we haven't actually /shipped/ anything.

    I'm going to go home and cry myself to sleep now.

*Friday, 7 October 1994, 6am.*

    We go live on the net in four days.

    I no longer think we're doomed. I think we're going to rock all
    over. It's still pretty scary, though.

    I went to the Halloween store that sprouted up around the corner,
    and got a cool giant troll mask that I mounted on a cardboard tube
    next to my cubicle door. It goes well with all the duct tape and
    grainy photocopied blow-ups.

    Today there was a reporter here from the LA Times; she interviewed
    all of us, and wandered around with Rosanne in tow, to do spin
    control. Rosanne was really concerned about here finding any
    confidential info, so the whole thing was kind of weird. From the
    questions she asked, we were guessing that it was going to be
    another fluff piece about personalities. She seemed to be digging
    for dirt, and the technical aspects have pretty much been beaten to
    death; could anyone really be interested in writing about them again?

    They took pictures. She said it would be out in a few weeks, either
    on the front page of the business section, or the main front page. Yow.

    CNN is coming in on monday to film a demo. CNN! Man.

    Chouck <http://people.netscape.com/chouck/> was in an incredibly
    pissy mood today, worse than usual. I made some joke about the fact
    that he doesn't like having his picture taken and he went ballistic.

*Monday, 10 October 1994, 5pm.*

    Well today has been more than a little bit frustrating. The details
    don't really matter (what does!), but I've spent most of the day so
    stressed out that my skull is rattling from the pressure of my teeth
    <toothdreams.html> grinding together. I feel like I have finally
    exceeded my stress <freedom.html> limits and am about blow a gasket.
    But I can't go home, because if I do, the world will end, right? I'm
    trying to work, but every few minutes I have to stop typing and make
    fists so tightly that my whole body shakes.

          Deep breathing. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out.

          BLAM BLAM BLAM!!!!! Aaaaaauuuuugggghhhhhh!!!! Cut the phone!
          Kill the dog!

    Cubicles have no doors to slam. I've been alternately chugging Coca
    Cola and Pepto Bismol. It's not helping.

    Some email from Laura
    <http://www.lne.com/lemay/essays/startuprant.html> says, ``You are
    rapidly approaching meltdown. Get out now.'' She told me that I need
    to go Coot Chasing. Apparently there's an open space preserve north
    of Shoreline and SGI <http://www.sgi.com/>, and at the end of a
    twisty road is a lake. Around this lake are hordes of little black
    birds called /coots/. They run around on the mud flat on little
    half-webbed feet, and when you chase them, their feet make a /phup
    phup phup/ noise. And if you get them really agitated, they /oink/,
    like little black feathered piggies.

    ``It is,'' she promises, ``the funniest fucking thing.''

    Coots know how to live. I wish I were a coot.

    Mr. Wizard, I think I'd rather be a coot than a hacker. Yeah, sure,
    every now and then a giant pink-haired <hair.html> ape would come
    running after me and chase me into the lake, but really, could it be
    that much worse? I'd have a tiny little brain <associate.html> and
    wouldn't be expected to worry about /anything/.

    They bought us Indian food for dinner today. I hate Indian food. I
    think I'm getting an ulcer.

*Wednesday, 12 October 1994, 11am.*

    It is two days later and I am still at the office. I did not go and
    chase coots. There is too much <contingency.html> work to do. I want
    to die.

    We're releasing Mozilla 0.9 today. I just finished doing the builds
    on six different Unix <unix.html> platforms, and of course, we
    discovered show-stoppingly disastrous bugs at 9am. We have fixed the
    bugs, and stared at the changes long and hard, and I'm in the
    process of rebuilding all of the binaries now. They should be done
    in about a half an hour, and they will be on the FTP server less
    than an hour after that.

    This is, of course, insane.

    Laura says that if we've only got an hour between building and
    shipping, then I must have been right all along: we are in fact well
    and truly doomed. She says that if I leave now, I can probably get a
    good head start before they realize that I'm gone.

    I forwarded her ``well and truly doomed'' paragraph to my manager,
    and he came in and yelled at me.

*6pm.*
    I'm still here. We got a slight reprieve, as everyone agreed to
    delay the release to midnight. People started testing my new builds
    at 1:50pm, which is when I went to sleep.

          At 2pm, I was awakened.

          By screams.

          As the building's power <electricity.html> went out.

          I am not making this up.

*midnight.*

    The power came back on, and we put the damnable program on the FTP
    <http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/> server, and two million
    people all started attempting to download it at once, before we had
    even posted the announcement message <newsrelease1.html>, and we're
    /done done done/ and I suppose now we can all live happily ever after.

    We sat in the conference room and hooked up the big TV to one of the
    Indys, so that we could sit around in the dark and watch the FTP
    download logs scroll by. jg <http://www.meer.net/jg/> hacked up an
    impromptu script that played the sound of a cannon shot each time a
    download successfully completed. We sat in the dark and cheered,
    listening to the explosions.

    Four hours later, the Wall Street Journal was delivered, and it
    already contained an article describing what we had just done.
    ``Clients aren't where the money is anyway,'' ran the quote from Marc.

    I'd go home now if I thought I could drive there without dying
    <jardream.html>, so instead I'm going to curl up under my desk again
    and sleep here.

    Maybe we're not doomed; people on the net are talking about Mozilla
    with all caps and lots of exclamation points. They're actually
    excited about it...

    I've just noticed that there's still purple ink on the inside of my
    right wrist spelling the word VOID: the hand-stamp from a concert
    <thread.html> that I went to last week. I left work, went to the
    show, and came back to work immediately afterwards. I've been here
    since.

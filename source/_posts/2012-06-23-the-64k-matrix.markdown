At the Vancouver Mini Maker Faire, this old Apple //e was showing
a simple demo:

    10 PRINT "Maker Faire ": GOTO 10

I decided a green-screen Matrix effect would be way cooler, so I
busted out some quarter-century old skillz to whip up this demo.

We downloaded an AppleSoft Basic PDF manual onto our phones, but
it turned out not be necessary. I remembered about half of what was
needed and another guy supplied the other half. Most of AppleSoft
Basic is burned into my neurons -- I started programming when I was
11.

I put the [source code](http://github.com/neilk/apple-ii-matrix)
up on Github. I find it hilarious that I'm putting an AppleSoft
BASIC program on Github.

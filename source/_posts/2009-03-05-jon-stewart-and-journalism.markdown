If you think the *Daily Show*'s Jon Stewart is doing journalism,
you don't know what journalism is.

It may not be your fault, especially if you are young. In your
lifetime, journalists are untrained monkeys asking uninformed
questions of celebrities. Stewart also does that, so maybe it seems
similar.

Stewart is a comedian. That's a very specific job and it's not all
about laughs. Seinfeld called comedy "the truth, only faster". It's
about seeing absurdity and pointing it out in a specific way that
makes you realize your own doubts, uncertainty, fears even. It makes
you laugh sometimes and cry other times.

Stewart can see absurdity, and point it out, but he's not doing
journalism and he would have no talent for it.

Journalism would be something like becoming an expert in derivatives
and risk and, based on that knowledge, asking CEOs of banks questions,
rooting out hidden problems in published balance sheets, maybe even
investigative reporting. Here you aren't hobnobbing with celebrities,
you are developing contacts in the records department of various
firms, interviewing recently fired or retired employees who have
an axe to grind, analyzing disclosed activities of lobbyists,
developing your own sources within Congress, and just generally
pursuing a story with dogged and grim determination until you finally
piece together the truth. And then, having the credibility to
fearlessly communicate that to an audience, advertisers be damned.

Stewart cannot do any of that. But he can point to the lack of it.

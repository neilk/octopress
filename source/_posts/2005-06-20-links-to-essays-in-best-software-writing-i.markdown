[Joel Spolsky](http://joelonsoftware.com/) has compiled a book of essays
on software, which he calls *[The Best Software Writing I](http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=453)*. The essays all
came from online sources, but when Spolsky released the chapter listing,
I didn't see anywhere online where he posted links to the originals. So
here they are.

**Caveat:** The print edition may have any number of improvements over
the online versions. Nevertheless, as long as some version of the essays
exist online, I don't see a reason not to link to them. Readers who
would like to have the authoritative version, with a rather attractive
cover, should go [buy the book](http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=453).

I do not have anything to do with Joel Spolsky other than reading his
blog occasionally. I am not the rightsholder for any of the offsite
content I link to below. (As of June 2005, I haven't even *read* most of
this, yet.)

### How I did it

Spolsky released the chapter listing in June 2005, and I noticed that a
lot of them were blog posts that I'd read before. I wondered how much of
the book was taken from online content. A few minutes of hacking later,
and a [programmed equivalent](/projects/bestswi/bestswi_pl.txt) of
[Google](http://google.com/)'s "I'm Feeling Lucky" had found most every
single chapter, or a page that was one degree of separation away.

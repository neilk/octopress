Summary:

* These are __important words__.
* And you should __listen__ to them.
* They help __speed reading__.

I made these with the [AutoStitch app](http://www.cloudburstresearch.com/autostitch/autostitch.html) on my iPhone, but instead of standing in one place and pivoting, I walked around objects. 

I had tried doing something similar a long time ago, back when it was a free program you could download from UBC... but in 2005, AutoStitch's SIFT algorithm tended to reject photo sets like this. The iPhone version seems to be more forgiving.
